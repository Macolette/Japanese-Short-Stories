Why Cats Chase Rats

Long ago, at a time when humans were not yet born into the world, the year was about to come to an end.

God gathered all the animals and spoke to them.

"It's almost the New Year.
Everyone please come to my place on New Year's day.
The first 12 to arrive will be made the 12 commanders of the year."

However, since the careless cat had forgotten to attend the meeting, he asked his friend the rat to tell him all about it.

With that, the rat lied and said "Ah, he said to come to him on the 2nd day of the New Year."

When New Year's day came, the cow left his home early in the morning because he knew that he walks very slowly.

The cunning rat secretly rode on the cow's back to get to God,

and with a "pyon!" he jump off in the front of the cow to become the first one to arrive before God.

And so, the rat was declared the 1st commander of the year while the cow became the 2nd.

Then came the tiger, the rabbit, the dragon, the snake, the horse, the sheep, the monkey, the rooster, the dog and the boar respectively.

As for the cat, he went to God on the 2nd day as instructed by the rat.

Then God said, "You're too late. Unfortunately the commanders have already been chosen yesterday."

Nobody told the cat about this. So he felt very annoyed.

"You trick me you rat!"

And so whenever the cat sees a rat, he chases continues to chase him around in anger.
